## üìã Database Setup (IMPORTANT - Must Run First!)

### Step 1: Update Materials Table
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add new columns to materials table
ALTER TABLE materials 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS price DECIMAL(10,2),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS thumbnail_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_link TEXT;
```

### Step 2: Create Orders Table
Run in Supabase SQL Editor (or use `/app/SUPABASE_ORDERS_SCHEMA.sql`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  material_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES materials(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  payment_link TEXT,
  razorpay_payment_id TEXT,
  razorpay_order_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  UNIQUE(user_id, material_id)
);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_material_id ON orders(material_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders(status);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own orders" ON orders
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create own orders" ON orders
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own orders" ON orders
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
